# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to enter the world of computer  progamming and coding through learning some basic concepts such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I chose to build this project as a place to take notes and help me study what I have learned during my prework modules. The problem this application solves is that it creates a place that is easy to find wher I can keep my study materials. I learned many things during my prework including, how to use the command line, GitHub, HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript.
